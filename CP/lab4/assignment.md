# Grading

For a grade of max __10__ you must cover the following functionalities:

| Functionality                | Points |
| ---------------------------- | ------ |
| __Signing in__               | 1 p    |
| __Selecting food type__      | 1 p    |
| __Selecting speciffic food__ | 2 p    |
| Selecting drink              | 1 p    |
| Choosing cutlery             | 1 p    |
| Adding additional info       | 1 p    |
| __Printing order__           | 1 p    |
| Going back                   | 2 p    |

The basic functionality is highlighted in the table above. Your assignment must have at least this functionality). The non-highlighted functionalities can be applied to the basic functionality independently (for example you don't need to add the `Selecting drink` functionality in oder to add the `Choosing cutlery` functionality).

For a grade of __5__ you must implement:

| Functionality                | Points |
| ---------------------------- | ------ |
| Signing in                   | 1 p    |
| Selecting food type          | 1 p    |
| Selecting speciffic food     | 2 p    |
| Printing order               | 1 p    |

__Please be aware of the fact that the order depends on the functionality implemented (for example if you don't implement the `Choosing cutlery` functionality, the `Cutlery: no` line shouldn't be in the order.__
