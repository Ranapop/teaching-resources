# Requirements

You are required to refactor your code for the `food-ordering` application to work with at least four structures. For each structure, you should define the structure and the functions that work with it in a `.h` file, and the implementations for those functions in a `.c` file (similar to how it was done for the car-shop application).

# Grading 

| Requirement                                                    | Points |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Work with at least 4 structures                                | 4 p    |
| Define the structures and functions in their own .h & .c file  | 4 p    |
| Properly allocate and free the memory                          | 2 p    |

You may be penalized for:
* incorrect behaviour
* long functions, bad naming, duplicate code, wrong formatting etc.
