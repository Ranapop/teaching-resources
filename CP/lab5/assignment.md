For this assignment, you will work upon the previous assignment.

You have to fulfill the same functionality requirements (so please correct any bugs you might have), but you must also fullfill the following code requirements:

* extract functionality in functions, each function being smaller than `15` lines of code (except the main function)
* break the project in at least 5 source files (except for `main.c` each `.c` file should have a `.h` file associtated, so have at least 3 `.c` files and at least 2 `.h` files)
