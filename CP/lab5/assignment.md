# Submission
You will continue working on the `food-ordering` repo. Make your changes on a development branch, and create a pull request with `ranapop` as a reviewer when you want your changes to be merged. Do not push on the master and do not merge the changes yourself.

# Requirements

For this assignment, you will work upon the previous assignment.

You have to fulfill the same functionality requirements (so please correct any bugs you might have), but you must also fullfill the following __code requirements__:

* extract functionality in functions, each function being smaller than `15` lines of code (except the main function which can have up to `60` for now)
* break the project in at least 5 source files (except for `main.c` each `.c` file should have a `.h` file associtated, so have at least 3 `.c` files and at least 2 `.h` files), where each module needs to have functions with a common topic
* define constants for maximum sizes
* give suggestive names to your variables, functions and files
* no global variables
