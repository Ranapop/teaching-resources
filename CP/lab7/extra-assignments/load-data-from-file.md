# Requirements

You will work on the `food-ordering` application and modify it to load the data from a file, not from the console. The data has to be loaded from the file `data.txt` located in the project structure. If the file is not present, the application will fallback to the console data loading.

If the file is present, the `Please load the data` message will not be present, and the data will be loaded directly from the file.

If the file is not present, the functionality will be that implemented in the compulsory assignment of lab 7.
