# Requirements

You will add saving data functionality to the `food-data-provider` application. You have to save the data in a file called `data.txt` (located in your project folder, at the same level with the main file). The data has to be saved in the format that will be loaded by the `food-ordering` application.

For the flow in https://github.com/Ranapop/teaching-resources/blob/master/CP/lab6/assignment.md the `data.txt` file should contain the following data:

```
3:
Pizza: (Pizza Carbonara - 21.00) (Pizza Diavola - 23.00) (Pizza Margherita - 19.00)
Pasta: (Chicken alfredo - 23.00) (Mac&cheese - 21.00)

```
