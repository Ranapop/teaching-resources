# Run a "Hello World" C project
* Have CLion installed on your computer
* Create a new project (C executable)
* Run the project (the default project should print "Hello world!")
Please check the tutorial from "lab1" if this is not working

# Have git installed
* Install git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git      
* For windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
* Check the installation by opening a command line (type "cmd" in the search bar) and type ```git version```. The result should be something like:
```
C:\Users\roxanappop>git version
git version 2.14.2.windows.3
```

# Create a GitHub account
* Create it here https://github.com/
