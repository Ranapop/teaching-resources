# Run a "Hello World" C project
* Have CLion installed on your computer
* Create a new project (C executable)
* Run the project (the default project should print "Hello world!")
Please check the tutorial from "lab1" if this is not working

# Have git installed
* Install git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
