Tutorials
* tutorial for cloning a repo [here](tutorials/cloning-a-repo.md)
* tutorial for pushing from CLion [here](tutorials/pushing-from-CLion.md)
* tutorial for pushing from the console [here](tutorials/pushing-from-cmd)

Regardless of weather you push from CLion directly or you use the console, it's important to push the CMakeLists.txt and the source files. If you push those files, you should be able to directly open your project with CLion from wherever you clone it (no need to push the files in the `cmake-build-debug`, those are autogenerated).
